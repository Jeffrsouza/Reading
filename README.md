Reading

	In this web application, we aim to display a timeline of posts, 
where the user can view posts, insert comments, edit and delete this data.
	The application allows sorting the posts by date or by vote score, 
also allows the filter by category.
	When you enter the post, you can select the category for the post.
	

For installation:

	Enter the root folder by the command pront, enter the "api-server" 
folder and execute "npm install" or "yarn install" after installing 
the dependencies "node server".
	Open another command prompt and do the same inside the frontend 
folder by installing the "npm install" or "yarn install" dependencies 
and then run "npm start" or "yarn start" to run the project.
